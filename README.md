# quake3 log parser



## Getting started

The log file was generated by a Quake 3 Arena server, including a great deal of information of every match.

The project implements the following functionalities:

- Read the log file

- Group the game data of each match

- Collect kill data

## Considerations

I've added the extra variable that can be configured to count or not count the suicides in the game.

```
###
# In some games, suicide is not considered a kill because it is not seen as a brave act.
# Because of that, you can choose if you want to increment the suicides to the killer score.
#
# suicide_count = 1 : suicide will be incremented in the killer score
# suicide_count = 0 : suicide will be NOT incremented in the killer score
#
# defaul value: 1
#####
```

## Usage

With the log file named 'qgames.log' in the same directory that 'quake3-log-parser.py' you can run:

```
python quake3-log-parser.py

```
